# Solutions to ISLR in Python language

This project was mainly build to contribute to knowledge on statistics and machine learning in python. The solutions are made on "Applied" exercises only and discuessed in order to increase understanding of the models that were used. They were coded in google colaboratory which is a platform made for combining executable code and rich text in a single document.
